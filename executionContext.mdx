title: Execution Context I
description: 'This will get a little complicated but if you hold on till the end this will clear alot of your doubts about how hoisting, scope chain and closure works? Why is javascript so weird?'

Whenever a script or program loads a global execution context is created. And every execution context goes through two phases:

1. Creation Phase: In this phase memory space is set up for variables, funcions declarations etc within that context.

2. Execution Phase: Where execution context is on the call stack and is executed.

  className="block dark:hidden"
  src="/images/globalexecontext.png"
  alt="Hero Light"
/>
<img
  className="hidden dark:block"
  src="/images/globalexecontext.png"
  alt="Hero Dark"
/>

## Creation Phase

Let's talk about all parts of Global Execution Context in detail.

<img
  className="block dark:hidden"
  src="/images/CreationPhase.png"
  alt="Hero Light"
/>
<img
  className="hidden dark:block"
  src="/images/CreationPhase.png"
  alt="Hero Dark"
/>

### Realm

The realm points to a realm record. Realm is an isolated environment is which our code runs. In browser a new realm is created whenever we open a new tab, refresh a page or use service works, web workers, iframes etc.

<img
  className="block dark:hidden"
  src="/images/Realm.png"
  alt="Hero Light"
/>
<img
  className="hidden dark:block"
  src="/images/Realm.png"
  alt="Hero Dark"
/>

Realm consists of intrinsics, Global Object, and Global Environment Record.

#### Intrinsics

Intrinsics provide all the standard build-in objects and functions that are essentially required to execute javascript. Eg: Array, Strings, Numbers, Syntax Errors etc.

#### Global Object

These are properties of global objects that can be accessed from anywhere inside the script.
1. Spec Properties: They are properties that exposes the intrinsics so that all the arrays, functions etc are present on the global object.
2. Host Defined Properties: These are browser properties such as fetch, set timeout, document onject etc.
3. User Defined Properties: As developers we can explicitly add properties to the global object or we can do it implicitly whenever we declare a function in the global scope or when we have a variable with var keyword in global scope.

#### Global Environment Record

Environment records manages the identifier bindings within that context. In case of global environment record these values are accessible throughout our entire script. It contains:
1. Object Record: It is just a direct reference to global object. Holds identifier bindings of var variable, function declarations etc.
2.Declarative Record: It contains all identifier bindings that aren't a variable with var keyword, function, object declarations etc.
3. Global "this" value: It contains the global "this" value which in most cases points to the global object.
4. Outer Env: In global environment record it contains null but it is an important property used in scope, scope chain, closure. When a new Function Execution Context is created this Outer Env points to its outer environment.

### Lexical Environment
Lexical Environment points to the Environment Record that contains the bindings for everything except for variable with var keyword which is Global Environment Record -> Declarative Record.

### Variable Environment Record
Points to the record which stores the bindings that contains the refrences to the variable with the var keyword usually Global Environment Record -> Object Record.

In the next article we will try to understand this with an example.
